Coveralls tracks code coverage in your Node.JS & Client JS projects

## Intro

### What is Code Coverage?

Code coverage measures how much of your source code is tested. 
A program with high code coverage has been more thoroughly tested 
and has a *lower chance* of containing software *bugs* than a program
with low code coverage.

#### Note

In the absence of other *objective* measures of code quality, 
projects I have worked on in the past use code coverage as a benchmark
for code completeness. 


### Why is Code Coverage Important?

While having 100% code coverage *does* ***not guarantee*** that your code is
free from *any* bugs, it does ensure that every line is 
being "exercised" so there is *less likelihood* of ***unexpected behaviour***. 

This ***reduces uncertainty*** *and* ***increases confidence*** in the code 
written by everyone on your team.
So when a bug does *inevitably* get discovered, you know


### What is Coveralls

Coveralls is a code coverage checking service. <br />
It does one thing well: tracking code coverage. <br />
It's *free* for open source projects so get started *today*!

# Get Started

## 3 Ways to Use Coveralls in a JavaScript Project

1. General JS: https://coveralls.io/docs/javascript
2. Node.JS (server side): https://coveralls.io/docs/node
3. Direct interface with Coveralls API: https://coveralls.io/docs/api 
(*beyond the scope of this tutorial*)


### General JavaScript

> TBC

### Node.JS 

Before we can check code coverage we need to write some code!
But since this is not the *focus* of this tutorial, I'm not going
to dwell on it too much. 

For a more detailed look at the code used here, see:

### Coveralls Pricing for "Private" (Closed Source) Projects

Like Travis CI, Coveralls is ***free for open source*** projects. <br />
Unlike Travis CI, Coveralls is "only"
[**$4.99** per month](https://coveralls.io/pricing) 
for a private repository! <br />
(**Travis**'s *entry-level* paid/private plan is 
[**$129** per month](http://travis-ci.com/plans)!)
